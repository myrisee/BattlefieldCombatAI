Ensure that the AI's BULLET PREFABS have their BulletScript's layermask value set to include the layer the player is on
Ensure that the AI Controller has it's layermask set to include the objects that make up your level
Ensure that the Cover nodes have their layermasks set to include the objects that make up your level
Ensure that the AI's EXPLOSION PREFABS have their layermasks set to include the objects that make up your level
Ensure that the RFPS Obsruction layermask in the grenade explosions DO NOT include the agent's physics layers


----

For whatever reason, upon import, Unity may remove any animation called "run" from all of the RFPS animators which causes a chain reaction and basically causes the whole game to fall apart. 
You'll need to manually replace these upon import.

RFPS changes the default timescale to 0. Make it 1 or add an RFPS player to the scene to make it work.
